# Analyzing_NYC_High_School_Data

This is primarily an exercise in cleaning and combining data.
It is also an exploratory analysis using matplotlib visualization to explore NYC High School SAT Scores vs Race, Gender, Safety.

New York City makes its [data on high school SAT scores](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2012-SAT-Results/f9bf-2cp4) available online as well as [the demographics for each high school](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2014-2015-DOE-High-School-Directory/n3p6-zve2).
